# Ola---Identified-the-reason-trend-for-ride-cancellation


## Project Overview
This project aims to identify trends and reasons for ride cancellations in Ola bookings using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. By analyzing booking data, we derive insights that help improve the user experience and reduce cancellations.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Initial data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: Data transformation, aggregation, and trend identification.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is contained in `bookings_dataset.xlsx`. It includes details on ride bookings such as:
- Booking ID
- Rider and driver details
- Booking time and location
- Ride status (Completed/Canceled)
- Cancellation reason (if any)
- Payment details

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Removed duplicates and null values using Excel.
   - Standardized date-time formats.
2. **SQL Analysis**
   - Loaded the dataset into a relational database.
   - Queried data to analyze cancellation trends by time, location, driver, and payment method.
3. **Power BI Visualization**
   - Created interactive dashboards with key insights such as:
     - Cancellation rate trends over time.
     - Most common reasons for cancellations.
     - Geographic distribution of cancellations.
     - Impact of payment method on ride completion.

## Key Insights
- High cancellation rates observed during peak hours.
- Cash payments had a higher rate of cancellations compared to digital transactions.
- Certain drivers and locations had consistently higher cancellation rates.
